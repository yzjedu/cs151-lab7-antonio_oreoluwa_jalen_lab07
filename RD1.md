The primary objective of this project was to develop a Flooring Cost Calculator that allows users to input the dimensions 
and type of flooring for multiple rooms, subsequently calculating the associated costs. This experience aimed to enhance my 
programming skills while solidifying my understanding of functions, user input handling, and conditional logic. By the end of the
project, I hoped to create a functional and user-friendly application that accurately computes flooring costs based on given parameters.

To solve the problem, I followed a structured approach. I began by figuring out the task needed to solve the problem. I then designed three 
main functions: get_room_info() for gathering user input, calculate_cost() for computing costs based on the input, and main() to orchestrate 
the overall flow of the program. With the functions outlined, I implemented them in a modular fashion, adding clear comments to enhance 
readability. Finally, I created a series of test cases to validate the program's functionality and robustness.

The results from my implementation matched my expectations. The program correctly calculated costs based on the provided inputs, 
demonstrating that the logic was sound. I tested various scenarios, including typical room dimensions and flooring types,
as well as edge cases like minimum input values and invalid entries. These tests confirmed that the program could handle a wide
range of inputs, reinforcing its reliability and effectiveness.

Throughout the project, I encountered several challenges, particularly with figuring out how to make sure the user could check the cost of another design
validation. Also, ensuring that the program could manage invalid inputs without crashing required careful thought and iteration. 
I adhered to the first three rules of programming: I wrote structured, modular code that was easy to read; I included comprehensive 
comments to clarify my logic; and I conducted extensive testing to identify and fix potential issues. By addressing these challenges through 
a cycle of refinement and thorough testing, I was able to produce a robust final product.

One key takeaway from this experience was the importance of user input validation, as it directly impacts user experience and program reliability. 
Overall, I feel that I accomplished the learning objectives set for this lab, gaining practical experience in programming concepts and techniques.

Working with my partner was helpful during development process. We were able to figure out the problem and tasks for each function collaboratively.
