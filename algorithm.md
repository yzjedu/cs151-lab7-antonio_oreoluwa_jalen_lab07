# Algorithm Document
Main tasks/functions:

2. Calculate cost per room
3. Calculate overall cost
4. Error checking 
5. Main function

1. Define constants 
   1. Hardwood = $1.39/sqft 
   2. Carpet = $3.99/sqft
   3. Tile = $4.99/sqft.
2. Define function to calculate room cost

- Purpose: function to calculate room cost
- Name: room cost
- Parameter: room length, room width, and flooring type
- Return: cost of one room
- Algorithm:
1. create new variable named 'room_dimensions'
2. multiply room width by room length using user defined values
3. assign result of previous calculation to room_dimensions variable.
4. multiply room dimensions by flooring type cost 
5. set result of previous calculation to new variable named 'room_cost'
5. return room cost

- Purpose: function to calculate total cost
- Name: total cost
- Parameter: room cost
- Return: total cost of all rooms 
- Algorithm:
1. 

3. Define the main function
4. Ask user if they want to check another design
