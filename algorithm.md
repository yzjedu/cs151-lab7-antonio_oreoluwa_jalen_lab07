# Algorithm Document
Main tasks/functions:

1. Calculate cost per room
2. Calculate overall cost
3. Main function

1. Define constants 
   1. Hardwood = $1.39/sqft 
   2. Carpet = $3.99/sqft
   3. Tile = $4.99/sqft.
   4. count = 0
   5. room 1 cost = 0
   6. room 2 cost = 0
   7. room 3 cost = 0
   8. room 4 cost = 0
   9. room 5 cost = 0
2. Define function to calculate room cost

- Purpose: function to calculate room cost
- Name: room cost
- Parameter: room length, room width, and flooring type
- Return: cost of one room
- Algorithm:
1. create new variable named 'room_dimensions'
2. multiply room width by room length using user defined values
3. assign result of previous calculation to room_dimensions variable.
4. multiply room dimensions by flooring type cost 
5. set result of previous calculation to new variable named 'room_cost'
5. return room cost

- Purpose: function to calculate total cost
- Name: total cost
- Parameter: room cost
- Return: total cost of all rooms 
- Algorithm:
1. 

3. Define the main function

- Purpose: Main function
- Name: Main
- Parameter: None
- Return: None
- Algorithm:
1. output program explanation to user
2. create while loop for if count is less than five. 
3. create while loop for if user input is invalid
   1. ask user to input room width and room length 
   2. ask user to
   1. if user input is invalid:
      2. ask user to input valid input
   1. else:
   

4. Ask user if they want to check another design
