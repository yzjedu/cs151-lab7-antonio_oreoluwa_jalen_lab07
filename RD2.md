### Objective
#### What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?
We were supposed to create a program that would calculate the total cost of remodeling the flooring of five rooms, given 
the flooring type, the width and the length of each room.

### Procedure
#### What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?
1. First, we created an algorithm which helped us decide how we wanted the program to function.
2. We created the test cases and flowcharts so we could visualize how the program was supposed to work and what it was 
   supposed to return.
3. we wrote out the code for the program, and worked on debugging until it functioned as intended.

#### What were the key concepts explored?
Defining and calling functions.

#### Did your results match what you expected to get?
Our results matched the results we had in the test cases, so yes.

#### Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?
We used various average test cases instead of extreme test cases.

### Reflection
#### What challenge did you encounter?
It was a bit challenging thinking of how we would create a while loop that would only loop 5 times.

#### How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?
Before coding, we created an algorithm, we made sure the code was readable by making variable names clear and including
comments, and we practiced for coding in this lab via the previous work we had with functions in lab 6.

#### Did you overcome them and how?
We used class notes as reference, and were eventually able to figure out how to create a loop that only looped 5 times.

#### Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?
I think working on this lab really helped with better understanding how to create and use functions.

#### What was it like working with your partner?
Working with Oreoluwa was very nice, she did a good job with the code and was great to work with for making the algorithm.
Jalen didnt really do anything. He never reached out to us, and he never did any work, at least that I am aware of.
